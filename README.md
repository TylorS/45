## Basic Usage

Create a test file

```js
// test/foo.js
import { describe, given, it } from '45';

export const test = describe('Array', [
  given('a few numbers', [
    it('length is greater than 0', ({ assert }) => {
      return assert([1, 2, 3].length > 0);
    })
  ])
])
```

In your terminal run

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/45 test/foo.js
